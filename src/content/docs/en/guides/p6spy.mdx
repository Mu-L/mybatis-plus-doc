MyBatis-Plus provides SQL analysis and printing functionality by integrating the `p6spy` component, which conveniently outputs SQL statements and their execution time. This feature is available for MyBatis-Plus version 3.1.0 and above.

## Introduction to p6spy

[`p6spy`](https://github.com/p6spy/p6spy) is a tool that intercepts and logs database access operations by proxying JDBC drivers. This means your application can use JDBC as usual while `p6spy` records all SQL statements and their execution times behind the scenes. This is particularly useful for SQL optimization during development and debugging.

`p6spy` offers more than just SQL logging; it also provides advanced features such as:

- **Slow SQL Detection**: By configuring `outagedetection` and `outagedetectioninterval`, `p6spy` can log SQL statements that exceed a specified execution time threshold.
- **Custom Log Formatting**: The `logMessageFormat` allows you to customize the output format of SQL logs, including timestamps, execution time, SQL statements, and more.
- **Log Output Control**: The `appender` configuration option lets you choose where logs are outputâ€”to the console, files, or logging systems.

`p6spy` is a powerful tool that provides MyBatis-Plus users with convenient SQL analysis and printing capabilities. With proper configuration, you can effectively monitor and optimize SQL statements during development and testing phases. However, due to performance overhead, it's recommended to use it cautiously in production environments.

## Example Project

To better understand how to use this feature, you can refer to the official example project:

- [mybatis-plus-sample-crud](https://gitee.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus-samples/tree/master/mybatis-plus-sample-crud)

## Dependency Installation

First, you need to add the `p6spy` dependency to your project. Here are the installation methods for both Maven and Gradle build tools:

<LastedDependency groupId="p6spy" artifactId="p6spy" />

## Configuration

Next, you need to make the appropriate configurations in either `application.yml` or `application.properties`.

### application.yml

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6SpyDriver
    url: jdbc:p6spy:h2:mem:test
    # Other database configurations...
```

### spy.properties

The `spy.properties` configuration file for `p6spy` contains multiple configuration options. Here are examples of some key configurations:

```properties
# Module list, choose appropriate configuration based on version
modulelist=com.baomidou.mybatisplus.extension.p6spy.MybatisPlusLogFactory,com.p6spy.engine.outage.P6OutageFactory

# Custom log format
logMessageFormat=com.baomidou.mybatisplus.extension.p6spy.P6SpyLogger

# Log output to console
appender=com.baomidou.mybatisplus.extension.p6spy.StdoutLogger

# Disable JDBC driver registration
deregisterdrivers=true

# Use prefix
useprefix=true

# Excluded log categories
excludecategories=info,debug,result,commit,resultset

# Date format
dateformat=yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss

# Actual driver list
# driverlist=org.h2.Driver

# Enable slow SQL recording
outagedetection=true

# Slow SQL threshold (in seconds)
outagedetectioninterval=2

# Filter SQL printing for tables starting with flw_
filter=true
exclude=flw_*
```

## Spring Boot Integration

For Spring Boot projects, you can use `p6spy-spring-boot-starter` to simplify the integration process.

### Dependency

<LastedDependency groupId="com.github.gavlyukovskiy" artifactId="p6spy-spring-boot-starter" />

### Configuration

```yaml
decorator:
  datasource:
    p6spy:
      # Log format
      log-format: "\ntime:%(executionTime) || sql:%(sql)\n"
      # Custom logger class
      logging: custom
      custom-appender-class: com.example.testinit.config.StdoutLogger
```

```java
public class StdoutLogger extends com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.StdoutLogger {
    public void logText(String text) {
        System.err.println(text);
    }
}
```

For more configuration information about `p6spy-spring-boot-starter`, please refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/gavlyukovskiy/spring-boot-data-source-decorator).

## Important Notes

- The `driver-class-name` should be configured to the driver class provided by `p6spy`.
- The `url` prefix should be `jdbc:p6spy` followed by the actual database connection address.
- If the printed SQL shows as `null`, add `commit` to the `excludecategories`.
- If batch operations don't print SQL, remove `batch` from `excludecategories`.
- For duplicate printing issues with batch operations, use `MybatisPlusLogFactory` (added in version 3.2.1).
- Please note that this plugin may introduce performance overhead and is not recommended for use in production environments.

By following these steps, you can conveniently analyze and print SQL statements during development. Remember to adjust configurations according to your specific needs for optimal usage.
