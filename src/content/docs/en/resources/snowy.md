### Product Introduction

Snowy is China's first national cryptographic frontend-backend separated rapid development platform, adopting Vue3+AntDesignVue3 + Vite+SpringBoot+Mp+HuTool+SaToken. It integrates national cryptographic encryption/decryption plugins, achieving true "inseparable" frontend-backend separation in a separated framework. Simultaneously, it supports adaptation to domestic hardware, middleware, and databases, making it your optimal choice.

The official website offers enterprise edition plugins such as workflow, multi-tenancy, multi-data sources, and Vue3 form designer for flexible use.

> PS: The Combined Edition (Mp Enterprise Edition + Snowy Enterprise Edition) refers to joint authorization from both parties, offering better value than purchasing separately.

### Architectural Features

- Frontend-backend separated architecture, independent development, aligned with mainstream development models
- Frontend primarily uses Vue3+Vite with AntdV as the UI framework
- Backend based on SpringBoot2, MybatisPlus as the data operation framework, and Redis as the caching framework
- Maven multi-module management, plugin-based development for easy installation, uninstallation, and upgrades, reducing coupling
- Business modules and APIs are decoupled, enabling convenient cross-module references
- Ingenious database design with standardized fields and easy extensibility
- Supports national cryptographic algorithms for encryption/decryption, effortlessly meeting domestic project security evaluation requirements
- Supports mainstream structured databases like MYSQL, ORACLE, SQLSERVER, and PGSQL
- Supports domestic databases and middleware such as Dameng and Kingbase
- Supports deployment on Windows, Linux, and domestic operating systems

### Security Features

- Utilizes SaToken, a lightweight Java permission authentication framework, powerful yet easy to learn
- Supports authentication modes like login authentication, permission authentication, SSO, third-party login, and OAuth2.0
- Enhanced RBAC permission design with independent resource and interface authorization for greater flexibility
- Supports button-level granular authorization with dynamic UI button display
- Supports API interface annotation-based and route interception-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access
- Innovative data scope mechanism allowing different data scopes per interface
- Supports rate limiting, anti-shake, and anti-duplicate submission to prevent dirty data
- Encrypts passwords, phone numbers, ID cards, etc., during transmission and storage using national cryptographic algorithms for enhanced security
- Operation logs use SM2 for integrity protection, meeting security audit requirements
