### Product Introduction

Snowy is China's first national cryptographic algorithm-enabled rapid development platform with frontend-backend separation architecture. It adopts Vue3 + AntDesignVue3 + Vite + SpringBoot + Mp + HuTool + SaToken. Integrated with national cryptographic encryption/decryption plugins, it truly achieves "inseparable encryption" in frontend-backend separation frameworks. Simultaneously, it supports adaptation to domestic hardware, middleware, and databases, making it your optimal choice.

The official website provides enterprise edition plugins including workflow, multi-tenancy, multiple data sources, Vue3 form designer, and more for flexible use.

> PS: The Combined Edition (Mp Enterprise Edition + Snowy Enterprise Edition) refers to joint authorization from both parties, offering better value than purchasing separately.
