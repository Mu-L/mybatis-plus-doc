### Product Introduction

Snowy is the first domestic front-end and back-end separated rapid development platform based on Chinese national cryptography, using Vue3+AntDesignVue3 + Vite+SpringBoot+Mp+HuTool+SaToken. It integrates encryption and decryption plugins based on Chinese national cryptography, truly achieving encrypted front-end and back-end separation; it also supports adaptation for domestic hardware models, middleware, and databases, making it your top choice.

The official website offers rich plugins like enterprise edition workflow, multi-tenancy, multiple data sources, and Vue3 form designer for flexible use.

> PS: The Joint Edition (Mp Enterprise Edition + Snowy Enterprise Edition) refers to joint authorization from both parties, which is more cost-effective than purchasing separately.

### Architecture Features

- Front-end and back-end separated architecture, independent development, conforming to mainstream development models.
- Front-end primarily uses Vue3+Vite technology, with AntdV as the UI framework.
- Back-end based on SpringBoot2, MybatisPlus as the data operation framework, and Redis as the caching framework.
- Maven multi-module management, plugin-based development for convenient installation, uninstallation, upgrading, and reduced coupling.
- Business modules are separated from APIs, allowing for convenient referencing between modules.
- Exquisite database design with standardized fields, easy to extend.
- Supports Chinese national cryptography algorithm encryption and decryption, stress-free for classified protection evaluation of domestic projects.
- Supports mainstream standard relational databases such as MYSQL, ORACLE, SQLSERVER, PGSQL.
- Supports domestic databases (e.g., DM DBMS, KingbaseES) and middleware.
- Supports deployment on Windows, Linux, and domestic operating systems.

### Security Features

- Adopts SaToken, a lightweight Java permission authentication framework that is powerful and has a low learning curve.
- Supports authentication modes such as login authentication, permission authentication, Single Sign-On (SSO), third-party login and OAuth2.0.
- Enhanced RBAC permission design with independent authorization for resources and interfaces for greater flexibility.
- Supports fine-grained independent authorization at the button level, with dynamic display of interface buttons.
- Supports annotation-based and route-interception-based authentication for API interfaces to prevent unauthorized access.
- Unique data scope mechanism, allowing each interface to be configured with different data scopes.
- Supports rate limiting and debouncing, prevents duplicate submissions, effectively preventing the generation of dirty data.
- Passwords, phone numbers, ID card numbers, etc., are transmitted and stored encrypted using Chinese national cryptography algorithms for enhanced data security.
- Operation logs use SM2 for integrity protection, meeting security audit requirements.
