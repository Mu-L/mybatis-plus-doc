[MyBatis-Plus](https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus) (MP) is an enhancement tool for [MyBatis](https://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) (MB). It provides enhancements without altering the core MB functionalities, and is born to simplify development and improve efficiency.

:::tip[Vision]
Our vision is to be the best partner for MyBatis, just like Player 1 and Player 2 in **Contra**. Like a dynamic duo, doubling efficiency.

## Features

- **Non-invasive**: Only enhances, does not change. Introducing MP won't affect existing projects, offering a seamless integration.
- **Low overhead**: Automatically injects basic CRUD operations upon startup with virtually no performance loss, allowing direct object-oriented operations.
- **Powerful CRUD operations**: Built-in generic mapper and service enable most CRUD operations for single tables with minimal configuration. Includes a powerful query builder to meet various usage needs.
- **Supports lambda expressions**: Conveniently write various query conditions using lambda expressions, eliminating worries about mistyping field names.
- **Supports automatic primary key generation**: Supports up to 4 primary key strategies (including a distributed unique ID generator - Sequence), freely configurable, perfectly solving primary key issues.
- **Supports active record pattern**: Entity classes can perform powerful CRUD operations simply by extending the model class.
- **Supports custom global generic operations**: Supports global generic method injection (Write once, use anywhere).
- **Built-in code generator**: Use code or a Maven plugin to quickly generate code for mapper, model, service, and controller layers. Supports template engines and numerous custom configurations.
- **Built-in pagination plugin**: Based on MyBatis physical pagination. Developers don't need to worry about specific operations; after configuring the plugin, writing pagination code is like a normal list query.
- **Pagination plugin supports multiple databases**: Supports MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, H2, HSQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.
- **Built-in performance analysis plugin**: Can output SQL statements and their execution time. Recommended to enable this feature during development and testing to quickly identify slow queries.
- **Built-in global interception plugin**: Provides intelligent analysis and blocking for full-table delete and update operations. Also allows custom interception rules to prevent accidental operations.

## Supported Databases
