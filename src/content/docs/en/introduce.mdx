[MyBatis-Plus](https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus) is an enhancement tool for [MyBatis](https://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/). It builds upon MyBatis without making any changes, aiming to simplify development and improve efficiency.

:::tip[Vision]
Our vision is to become the best companion for MyBatis, just like the 1P and 2P in **Contra**, where teamwork doubles efficiency.

## Features

- **Non-intrusive**: Only enhances without altering existing code. Introducing it won't affect your current project—smooth as silk.
- **Minimal overhead**: Automatically injects basic CRUD operations upon startup with negligible performance impact, enabling direct object-oriented operations.
- **Powerful CRUD operations**: Built-in universal Mapper and Service. With minimal configuration, you can perform most single-table CRUD operations. Plus, a robust condition constructor meets diverse needs.
- **Lambda-style calls**: Write query conditions conveniently using Lambda expressions, eliminating worries about field typos.
- **Automatic primary key generation**: Supports up to 4 primary key strategies (including distributed unique ID generator - Sequence), configurable freely to solve primary key issues perfectly.
- **ActiveRecord mode support**: Entities can inherit the Model class to perform powerful CRUD operations in ActiveRecord style.
- **Custom global operations**: Supports global generic method injection (Write once, use anywhere).
- **Built-in code generator**: Quickly generate Mapper, Model, Service, and Controller layer code via code or Maven plugin. Supports template engines and offers numerous custom configurations.
- **Built-in pagination plugin**: Based on MyBatis physical pagination. Developers need not worry about details—configure the plugin, and pagination queries work like regular List queries.
- **Pagination plugin supports multiple databases**: MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, H2, HSQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, and more.
- **Built-in performance analysis plugin**: Outputs SQL statements and their execution time. Recommended for development/testing to quickly identify slow queries.
- **Built-in global interceptor plugin**: Intelligently analyzes and blocks full-table delete/update operations. Custom rules can be added to prevent accidents.

## Supported Databases
