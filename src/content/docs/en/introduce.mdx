[MyBatis-Plus](https://github.com/baomidou/mybatis-plus) is an enhancement toolkit for [MyBatis](https://www.mybatis.org/mybatis-3/). It builds upon MyBatis to provide additional capabilities without making any changes to the core framework, aiming to simplify development and improve efficiency.

:::tip[Vision]
Our vision is to become the perfect partner for MyBatis, just like Player 1 and Player 2 in **Contra** - working together to double your efficiency.

## Features

- **Non-invasive**: Only enhances without altering existing functionality. Introducing it won't impact your current project - it integrates smoothly
- **Minimal overhead**: Automatically injects basic CRUD operations upon startup with virtually no performance impact, enabling direct object-oriented operations
- **Powerful CRUD operations**: Built-in universal Mapper and Service. Achieve most single-table CRUD operations with minimal configuration, plus a powerful condition constructor to meet various needs
- **Lambda support**: Write query conditions conveniently using Lambda expressions, eliminating worries about field name errors
- **Automatic primary key generation**: Supports up to 4 primary key strategies (including distributed unique ID generator - Sequence), freely configurable to perfectly solve primary key issues
- **ActiveRecord mode support**: Supports ActiveRecord-style calls. Entities simply need to inherit the Model class to perform powerful CRUD operations
- **Custom global operations**: Supports global universal method injection (Write once, use anywhere)
- **Built-in code generator**: Quickly generate Mapper, Model, Service, and Controller layer code using code or Maven plugins. Supports template engines with numerous custom configurations
- **Built-in pagination plugin**: Based on MyBatis physical pagination. Developers don't need to worry about specific operations - after configuring the plugin, pagination queries are as simple as regular List queries
- **Pagination plugin supports multiple databases**: Supports MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, H2, HSQL, SQLite, Postgre, SQLServer, and more
- **Built-in performance analysis plugin**: Outputs SQL statements and their execution time. Recommended for development and testing to quickly identify slow queries
- **Built-in global intercept plugin**: Provides intelligent analysis and blocking for full-table delete/update operations. Custom interception rules can be defined to prevent accidental operations

## Supported Databases

<SupportDb />

:::tip
Any database that can perform CRUD operations with MyBatis and supports standard SQL should be within MyBatis-Plus's support scope. The specific support status is shown above.

If your desired database type isn't listed, we welcome your PR for its database dialect.
